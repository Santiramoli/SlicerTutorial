# 📦 MyFirstExtension

A simple 3D Slicer extension to demonstrate how to create custom scripted modules using Python.
Developed as part of learning and experimentation with Slicer modules and logic.

# 🧩 Modules
## MyFirstModule
This module is a basic example automatically generated by the extension template. It serves as a starting point for future developments. It does not contain complex logic or processing operations.

## SphereModule
This module allows you to generate a 3D sphere from two fiducial points placed in the scene.

- 📌 Input: vtkMRMLMarkupsFiducialNode with two points.
- 📦 Output: vtkMRMLModelNode representing the created sphere.
- ⚙️ Options: `Image Threshold` for opacity of the sphere and `Auto Update` to automatically updates the sphere.
- 📍 It also calculates the center of mass of the defined points.
